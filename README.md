# Machine Learning challenge

## (1) Spotify song popularity prediction

 - Participated in a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/song-popularity-prediction) to predict popularity of songs given song features
 - Digged a lot on how to deal with outliers and ML algorithms sensitive to outliers
 - Learned many more techniques to deal Imbalanced data

## (2) Student Acceptance prediction

 - Practiced on a [Kaggle Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahwiz/school-data) to predict whether student get admission 
 -  The Results are:
 
**Logistic Regression:**

 * Accuracy of Logistic Regression is 0.475

 * Accuracy of Logistic Regression is 59.5

**Support Vector Machine**

 * Accuracy of Support Vector Machine is 0.65

 * Accuracy of Support Vector Machine is 50.0


**Notes:**
Here I have not removed the outliers(Need to remove it and train again)
Used Label Encoder to handle categorical data(Can use better encoding techniques)
Used simple classifiers - Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine
